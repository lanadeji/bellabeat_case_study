Bellabeat’s app and multiple smart devices collect data on activity, sleep, stress, hydration levels, and reproductive health to empower women with an understanding of their own health and habits. The company was founded in 2013 by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur and has expanded quickly since, now with the possibility to become a greater player in the global smart device market.\n\nBellabeat’s product line is made up of the Bellabeat app, which allows users insight into their health by providing data on their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. The Bellabeat app also connects to the company’s line of smart device products. Leaf is Bellabeat’s classic wellness tracker that can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip. Leaf tracks the user’s activity, sleep, and stress and connects to the Bellabeat app. Time is a wellness smart watch that also tracks the user’s activity, sleep, and stress and connects to the Bellabeat app. Spring is a smart water bottle that tracks the daily water intake of its user to ensure proper hydration levels are maintained throughout the day. Spring also connects to the Bellabeat app to track this data. Bellabeat membership is a subscription-based membership program that provides users 24/7 access to fully personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health, beauty, and mindfulness based on their lifestyle and goals.\n\n## Business Task\nAnalyze smart device useage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat devices and then use discovered insights to guide marketing strategy.

There is a clear relationship between calories burned and active time.\n2. The more time a user spends on sedentary activities, the less calories the user burns on a daily basis.\n3. The average user is most active mid-week and least active on weekends.\n4. On average, a user spends about 81% of active time doing sedentary activities.\n5. For the average user, total time spent in bed is close to total time asleep, indicating minimal struggle with insomnia. \n\n### Recommendations for Bellabeat \nTo further expand business opportunities for Bellabeat, key findings from the analysis can be used to guide some business decisions. Some recommendations for Bellabeat app and products are as follows:\n1. Recommend a minimum of 10,000 steps for users. This can drive a higher proportion of activity time dooing non-sedentary activities.\n2. Enable periodic reminders (e.g., push notifications) for users to take a minimum number of steps every hour.\n3. Provide options for tracking other health-related data like weight. \n4. Provide in-app wellness tips and suggestions.\n5. Create weekend fitness challenges to encourage users to be more active on weekends.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### References:\n1. G;, J. M. S. K. B. (n.d.).
